# Learning Paths

This directory contains guided reading sequences through the concepts in this repository.

Unlike the `concepts/` directory, which serves as a non-linear reference, learning paths are designed to be followed in order. Each path builds on the previous one, introducing concepts in a sequence that supports comprehension.

## Available paths

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [01-absolute-beginner.md](01-absolute-beginner.md) | Start here if you are new to RAG. Covers foundational concepts in a structured order. |

## How to use learning paths

1. Choose a path based on your current level of familiarity.
2. Read the concept files in the order listed within the path.
3. Return to `concepts/` as a reference once you have completed the path.

Learning paths do not replace the concept files. They provide a recommended order for first-time readers.
